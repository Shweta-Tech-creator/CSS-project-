      <h1>About Shweta Kadam</h1>
    </div>

    <p>
      Hi, I’m Shweta Kadam, a first-year BTech student with a deep passion for coding, technology, and innovation. 
      I’m always exploring new ways to challenge myself and grow—whether it's through hackathons, coding projects, or learning about emerging technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve had the privilege of working on several exciting projects, including developing AI tools for business contracts and creating websites that suggest medical solutions. I’m also a big fan of AR/VR technologies and have received certifications in Snapchat filter creation and GenAI.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether I’m breaking records at hackathons or building my startup, Kadam Chromatics, I’m constantly seeking new opportunities to make an impact. My goal is to build tools and systems that not only innovate but also improve lives.
